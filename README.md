## 📖 About This Study

In the first century, a group called the Judaizers taught that Gentile believers needed to follow the Mosaic Law — especially circumcision — to be truly saved. Paul called this "a different gospel" and opposed it with everything he had.

Why? Because **adding anything to Christ's finished work is an attack on the gospel itself.**

This study traces the controversy through Scripture:
- The Judaizers' teaching and why it was dangerous
- The Jerusalem Council's official verdict
- Paul's confrontation with Peter
- The true purpose of the Law
- Shadow vs. Substance in Christ
- The New Covenant promise
- Freedom in Christ
- Resting in the finished work

## 🎯 Key Scriptures

### The Judaizing Error
- **Acts 15:1** - "Unless circumcised... you cannot be saved"
- **Galatians 1:6-9** - "A different gospel — no gospel at all"
- **Galatians 2:21** - "If righteousness through law, Christ died for nothing"

### The Purpose of the Law
- **Galatians 3:19** - Added because of transgressions
- **Galatians 3:24-25** - Guardian until Christ came
- **Romans 3:20** - Through law, consciousness of sin

### Shadow and Substance
- **Colossians 2:16-17** - Shadow vs. reality in Christ
- **Hebrews 8:5** - Copy and shadow of heavenly things
- **Hebrews 10:1, 14** - One sacrifice, perfect forever

### The New Covenant
- **Jeremiah 31:31-34** - Not like the old covenant
- **Ezekiel 36:26-27** - New heart, Spirit within
- **Hebrews 8:13** - Old covenant obsolete

### Freedom and Rest
- **Galatians 5:1** - For freedom Christ set us free
- **Romans 6:14** - Under grace, not law
- **John 19:30** - "It is finished"
- **Hebrews 1:3** - Christ sat down
- **Romans 8:1** - No condemnation

## 💡 Key Concepts

### The Judaizers' Error
- Faith in Christ **plus** Torah observance for salvation
- Not rejecting Jesus — adding to Jesus
- Paul's verdict: "a different gospel" = no gospel

### Why It Matters
- If law saves, Christ died for nothing
- Adding to Christ insults His sufficiency
- Returns people to bondage they cannot bear

### Shadow vs. Substance
| Shadow (Old Covenant) | Substance (Christ) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Sacrifices repeated | One sacrifice, forever |
| Earthly tabernacle | Heavenly reality |
| External ceremonies | Internal transformation |
| Temporary | Eternal |

### From vs. For
- **Wrong:** Obedience **toward** acceptance
- **Right:** Obedience **from** acceptance

## 📝 Memory Verses

- **Galatians 2:21** - "If righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!"
- **Galatians 5:1** - "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free."
- **Colossians 2:17** - "These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ."

## 🔑 The Truth

Christ is enough. His work is finished. You are accepted. Rest in Him.

**You don't need Christ plus your effort. You don't need Christ plus your church attendance. You don't need Christ plus anything. You need Christ. And you have Him.**
